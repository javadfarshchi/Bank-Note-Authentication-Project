# Bank Note Authentication Project

In this project, we will use machine learning to create a model that is capable of determining if a bank note is authentic or fake. 

We'll use the [Bank Authentication Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication) from the UCI repository.

The data consists of 5 columns:

* variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
* skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
* curtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
* entropy of image (continuous)
* class (integer)

Where class indicates whether or not a Bank Note was authentic.

Complete notebook of the code can be found [here](https://github.com/javadfarshchi/Bank-Note-Authentication-Project/blob/main/Bank%20Note%20Authentication%20.ipynb).

Below we can see the data correlation of the dataset columns:

The following image shows the evaluation metrics for the model.
